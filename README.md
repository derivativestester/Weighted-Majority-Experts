Having installed LaTeX, open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project and create a conda environment using the following command:
```
conda create -n blank python=3.12
conda activate blank
```
and then install the dependencies with pip
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can then navigate to the `src` directory and then run 
```
